I am Maiko Metsalu, a software engineer

Iâ€™m writing and teaching code daily, always looking for new creative projects.

Currently I have decided to start learning Micronaut, a Java framework for building microservices.

I am extremely eager to learn how large systems work. I also love teaching young people how to write code.
